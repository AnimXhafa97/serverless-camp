## About Me
Hi, I'm Anim! I'm from NY and I like pizza, bagels, and skyscrapers. My favorite sport is soccer. I used to play the guitar when I was younger, but now I don't. Some things that excite me are travel plans, soccer matches, and freestyle raps. I hope to learn more about all of you throughout this camp!
